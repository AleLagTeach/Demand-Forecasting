In an additive model, the observed value is the sum of trend, seasonality, and residual components: Y(t) = Trend(t) + Seasonality(t) + Residual(t). This works best when the magnitude of seasonal fluctuations or residuals remains constant over time, regardless of the trend’s growth or decline. For example, if a retail business sees a consistent quarterly sales increase of $10,000 during the holidays every year, regardless of overall sales growth, an additive model would capture this fixed seasonal effect. Additive models are simpler to implement and interpret, as components are directly added. However, they fail when seasonal patterns grow or shrink proportionally with the trend. For instance, if holiday sales grow from 10% to 15% of annual revenue as the business expands, the additive approach would underestimate seasonal effects over time.

A multiplicative model represents the observed value as the product of its components: Y(t) = Trend(t) * Seasonality(t) * Residual(t). This is suitable when seasonal or residual effects scale with the trend. For example, a tech company’s user growth might show a seasonal pattern where summer adoption rates dip by 20% relative to the underlying trend. If the trend itself grows exponentially, the absolute size of the seasonal dip (e.g., 1,000 users in year one vs. 10,000 users in year five) would also grow, making multiplicative decomposition more accurate. Multiplicative models are flexible but require careful handling. They often involve log transformations (to convert multiplication into addition for analysis) and assume all components are positive. They can also be sensitive to outliers or zero values, which might break the multiplicative structure.
